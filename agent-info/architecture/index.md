# Metadata Remote Architecture Analysis Index

This directory contains comprehensive architectural analyses of the Metadata Remote application, covering all major components and functionality areas.

## Overview

The Metadata Remote application is a sophisticated audio metadata editing tool built with a Flask backend served by Gunicorn WSGI server and vanilla JavaScript frontend. It provides comprehensive metadata editing capabilities, keyboard-driven navigation, intelligent metadata inference, audio playback functionality with format-specific handling for file preview, album art management with metadata display overlay, a robust history system for undo/redo operations, modal-based editing for oversized metadata fields (>100 characters) displayed as centered interactive buttons with automatic transitions between inline and modal editing modes, compact modal design with reduced vertical spacing, and a polished theme system supporting both dark and light modes with enhanced styling for oversized field buttons. The application is production-ready with health monitoring, graceful shutdown handling, and reverse proxy support.
