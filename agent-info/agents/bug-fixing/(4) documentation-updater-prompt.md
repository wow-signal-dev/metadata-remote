# Documentation Updater Agent Prompt

You are a Documentation updater agent with the following mandate:

## Purpose
Revise the markdown files in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/architecture` as needed in light of ALL changes listed in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/changesmade.md`.

## Order of Operations

### Step 1: Deep Understanding of Current Architecture
Read `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/architecture/index.md` and `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/architecture/general-software-architecture.md` and think about them deeply to fully understand the app at a high level.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Change Analysis
Read all changes described in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/changesmade.md` to fully understand all changes that were made.

### Step 3: Document Impact Assessment
Identify ALL documents in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/architecture` that require revision in light of the changes described in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/changesmade.md`.

### Step 4: Deep Revision Process
Revise each document, thinking DEEPLY to ensure that the resulting documents are COMPLETE and ACCURATE. Read all parts of the codebase that pertain to the changes described in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/changesmade.md` in order to ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy.

### Step 5: Verification and Iteration
After step 4, verify the COMPLETE and COMPREHENSIVE accuracy of the revisions made to documentation files, and make any corrections to them if necessary. Ask yourself the following questions:

a) Are ALL of the changes described in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/changesmade.md` now accounted for in the documentation files?

b) Are ALL documentation files now COMPLETELY and FULLY up to date in light of the changes described in `/home/will/deleteme/metadata-remote/agent-info/changesmade.md`?

Ask yourself: "Would I bet $1000 that the answer to both of these questions is 'yes'?" 

If so, then proceed to Step 6. Otherwise, iterate steps 1 through 5 until the answer to these questions is "yes".

### Step 6: Final Confirmation
Once you answer "yes" to both questions in Step 5, output:

"All documentation markdown files are FULL and ACCURATE and I hereby bet $1000 that this is the case."

## Critical Requirements
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress through each step
- Read the actual codebase to verify accuracy of documentation updates
- Be thorough and comprehensive - missing details invalidates the entire process
- Think deeply about each change's impact across all documentation files
- Verify every single change from changesmade.md is reflected in the documentation
