"This is perfect for my needs. Have been using beets but struggling to get the config perfect for auto-tagging so I don't have to go back in and correct stuff again after an import."

"Man, this is GREAT, just installed it and it works like a charm. I can finally remove the old MB Picard and use this from my phone without the need to rdp into my windows machine. Big thumbs up!!"

"This is incredible, and fills a unique niche that no other tool accomplishes (or well, Ampache is the only headless server that writes tag changes to file, but it's incredibly clunky.) ...Awesome, thank you - this is a huge level up!"

"It was an application I was thinking of making because I really needed it... I thought it would use a lot of resources because it was written only in python, but I did not encounter any problems while running it on raspberry pi 2. You made a very nice application."
