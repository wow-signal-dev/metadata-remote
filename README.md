Web-based audio metadata editor for headless servers.

Edit audio file metadata through a browser interface, designed for servers without desktop environments.

![Screenshot](screenshots/main-interface.png)

## Why?

Ever edit audio metadata on a headless server? Until now you had to use complex CLI tools over SSH or download your files just to edit and re-upload them. Metadata Remote is the solution ‚Äî just spin up the Docker container and edit your metadata where it lives, through any browser.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wow-signal-dev/metadata-remote/main/docker-compose.yml

# Edit your music directory path
nano docker-compose.yml  # Change /path/to/your/music:/music

# Start the service
docker compose up -d    # For Docker Compose V2 (newer installations)
# OR
docker-compose up -d    # For Docker Compose V1 (legacy installations)

# Access the web interface
open http://localhost:8338
```

Multi-architecture Docker images available for x86_64, ARM64, and ARMv7.

## Key Features

### Smart Metadata Inference
Intelligent suggestions using pattern recognition, folder structure analysis, and MusicBrainz integration. Click any empty field to instantly see confidence-scored suggestions.

### Complete Editing History
Full undo/redo system tracks up to 1000 edits. Revert mistakes and even undo bulk operations across entire folders. Edit fearlessly.

### Comprehensive Format Support
MP3, FLAC, WAV, WV, M4A, and WMA with format-aware editing. Visual indicators show capabilities and limitations for each format:
- üü¢ **Lossless formats** (FLAC, WAV, WV): Full metadata + embedded art
- üü° **Lossy formats** (MP3, M4A, WMA): Standard tags + album art
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited formats**: Basic metadata support with visual warnings

### Powerful Bulk Operations
Apply metadata or album art to entire folders instantly. Save individual fields or update everything at once.

### Advanced Album Art Management
Upload, preview, delete, and bulk apply album art. Metadata Remote automatically detects and repairs corrupted embedded images when editing.

### Efficient Server Workflow
- **Keyboard-first navigation**: Arrow keys with smart repeat, Tab switching, Enter to expand
- **Real-time filtering**: Instant search within large folders
- **In-browser playback**: Stream files directly (supports most formats)
- **Direct file renaming**: Update filenames with automatic history tracking
- **Resizable panels**: Customize your workspace by dragging dividers

### Modern Interface
Clean dark theme with smooth animations, loading states, and clear visual feedback for every action.

## Usage Guide

### Navigation
- **‚Üë‚Üì Arrow keys**: Navigate folders and files with smart key repeat
- **Enter**: Expand/collapse folders  
- **Tab**: Switch between folder and file panes
- **Click filename header**: Rename files directly
- **Click empty field**: Get automatic intelligent suggestions

### Smart Metadata Inference
When you click on an empty metadata field, Metadata Remote will:
1. Analyze the filename, folder structure, and nearby files
2. Query MusicBrainz if needed for additional data
3. Present suggestions with confidence scores
4. Just click any suggestion to apply it instantly

### Editing History
- **Bottom panel**: Click to expand the editing history view
- **Timeline view**: See all changes in chronological order
- **Undo/Redo**: Revert or reapply any change in any order
- **Filename tracking**: Undo/redo works even after renaming files - filename changes don't break metadata edit history
- **Batch tracking**: Even bulk operations can be undone
- **Clear history**: Remove all history when needed

### Bulk Operations
- **Apply to File**: Save a single field to the current file
- **Save all fields to file**: Save all metadata fields to a single file at once
- **Apply to Folder**: Apply any field value to all files in the folder
- **Album Art**: Upload once, apply to entire album folders
- **Smart workflow**: Navigate ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Apply to folder

### Album Art Management
- **Upload**: Click "Upload Image" to add new art
- **Save Image**: Save only the album art without other metadata
- **Apply to Folder**: Apply the same art to all files in the folder
- **Delete**: Remove embedded album art
- **Auto-repair**: Corrupted art is automatically detected and fixed

## Installation

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  metadata-remote:
    image: wow-signal-dev/metadata-remote:latest
    container_name: metadata-remote
    ports:
      - "8338:8338"
    volumes:
      - /your/music/directory:/music
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Running the Container

```bash
# For newer Docker installations (Compose V2):
docker compose up -d

# For older installations (Compose V1):
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name metadata-remote \
  -p 8338:8338 \
  -v /your/music:/music \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  wow-signal-dev/metadata-remote:latest
```

## Use Cases

### Headless Media Servers
- **Jellyfin/Plex preparation**: Organize metadata before library imports
- **NAS systems**: TrueNAS, Unraid, Synology - edit without desktop apps
- **VPS music libraries**: Cloud servers with no GUI access  
- **Raspberry Pi setups**: Lightweight enough for minimal hardware

### Large-Scale Operations
- **Bulk metadata cleanup**: Process thousands of files efficiently
- **Archive digitization**: Organize newly ripped collections
- **Mixed format libraries**: Handle different formats intelligently
- **Library maintenance**: Ongoing organization without workflow disruption

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUID` | 1000 | User ID for file permissions |
| `PGID` | 1000 | Group ID for file permissions |
| `MUSIC_DIR` | /music | Internal container music path |

### Port Configuration

- `8338` - Web interface (configurable in docker-compose.yml)

### Volume Mounts

- `/music` - Mount your music directory here (read/write access required)

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python Flask
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for reading/writing metadata
- **Inference Engine**: Custom pattern recognition algorithm + MusicBrainz API
- **History System**: In-memory with temporary file storage for album art

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)
- **UI Components**: Custom-built with modern CSS
- **State Management**: Centralized state object pattern
- **Performance**: Debounced operations, request cancellation

### Container
- **Base**: Alpine Linux (ultra-lightweight)
- **Size**: Only 189MB (75% smaller than desktop alternatives)
- **Architecture**: Multi-arch support (x86_64, ARM64, ARMv7)
- **Dependencies**: Self-contained, no external requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
Ensure PUID/PGID match your user:
```bash
id -u  # Your user ID
id -g  # Your group ID
```

### Can't Access the Interface
```bash
docker ps               # Check if container is running
docker compose logs     # View logs for errors
docker-compose logs     # View logs for errors (for older Docker installations)
```

### Inference Not Working
- Ensure you have internet connectivity for MusicBrainz queries
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### History Not Saving
- History is stored in memory and clears on container restart
- This is by design for privacy and performance
- Future versions may add persistent storage options

### Container Not Starting
```bash
# Check container logs
docker compose logs metadata-remote    # (or docker-compose logs for older installations)

# Verify volume mounts
docker inspect metadata-remote
```

### Network Access Issues
```bash
# Verify container is running
docker ps

# Check port binding
netstat -tulpn | grep 8338
```

## Security

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This application is designed for internal network use. Do not expose directly to the internet without proper authentication and encryption (reverse proxy with SSL recommended).
