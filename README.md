## üöÄ Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is using our pre-built Docker image.

> **Note:** Our image supports x86, ARM, and Apple Silicon processors automatically. Docker will download the correct version for your device.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A music directory to manage

### Installation

1. Download the docker-compose.yml file:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wow-signal-dev/metadata-remote/main/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Edit the music directory path in `docker-compose.yml`:
```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
# Change the line: /path/to/your/music:/music
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8338`

That's it! The container will automatically download and run the latest version.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PUID`: User ID for file permissions (default: 1000)
- `PGID`: Group ID for file permissions (default: 1000)
- `MUSIC_DIR`: Music directory path (default: /music)

### Ports
- `8338`: Web interface (customizable in docker-compose.yml)

### Volumes
- `/music`: Your music directory (read/write access required)

## üîí Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This application is designed for LOCAL USE ONLY and should NEVER be exposed to the internet without proper authentication and encryption.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python Flask
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for reading/writing metadata
- **Inference Engine**: Custom pattern recognition algorithm + MusicBrainz API
- **History System**: In-memory with temporary file storage for album art

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)
- **UI Components**: Custom-built with modern CSS
- **State Management**: Centralized state object pattern
- **Performance**: Debounced operations, request cancellation

### Container
- **Base**: Alpine Linux (ultra-lightweight)
- **Size**: Only 189MB (75% smaller than alternatives)
- **Architecture**: Multi-arch support (x86_64, arm64, armv7)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
Ensure PUID/PGID match your user:
```bash
id -u  # Your user ID
id -g  # Your group ID
```

### Can't Access the Interface
```bash
docker ps               # Check if container is running
docker-compose logs     # View logs for errors
```

### Inference Not Working
- Ensure you have internet connectivity for MusicBrainz queries
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### History Not Saving
- History is stored in memory and clears on container restart
- This is by design for privacy and performance
- Future versions may add persistent storage options
